HTEC foot is designed for humanoid robots, aiming to absorbing the contact impace, also ensuring the supporting stability.

We have designed the structure and configured the optimal parameters, which can enable the foot balance between adabtablity and stability.

The foot have passive deformation capability to adapt to the ground.

If you are interest about our foot, or if you are a humanoid robot enineer, who concentrated on the foot structure. Please contact me. And I will help you to construct a considerable foot strucure.
